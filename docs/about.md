# Profile
Passionate researcher and emerging academic, specialising in the application of AI to Earth science and dynamical systems. Committed to advancing knowledge through high-impact research. Experienced in teaching through lecturing, demonstrating, and running workshops, and keen to further develop as an effective and engaging educator. An intuitive problem solver with excellent presentation and communication skills. Proactive, independent, and driven to contribute to both academic scholarship and departmental development.

# Education
#### PhD, AI/ML for Earth Systems, University of Reading (2021-2025)

_Thesis: Machine learning and complex network techniques to inform marine biogeochemistry modelling and data assimilation_

_Based at the University of Reading Meteorology Department, with strong links to Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) and National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO)._

#### BSc Computer Science with Industrial Year, First class, University of Reading (2015-2019)

_Dissertation: Detection and analysis of land cover change in sequential satellite images using convolutional neural networks._

#### Interests and Work Area
- Working at the intersection of environmental modelling, data assimilation, and machine learning, developing computational approaches to improve predictions in various Earth systems.
- Exploring how machine learning and data assimilation can enhance the integration of models with observational data, supporting applications for more accurate and efficient marine ecosystem modelling and urban environmental forecasting.
- Further interest in developing explainable AI in Earth system science, interrogating the "black-box" nature of machine learning approaches to extract physical insight from data-driven models and strengthen the link between predictive performance and scientific understanding.


#### Explainable AI for Weather and Climate (in collaboration with the Met Office, 2025)
_Weather and climate systems are inherently complex, dynamic, and nonlinear, posing significant challenges for the development of trustworthy artificial intelligence methods. In response, a collaborative project between the University of Reading and the UK Met Office is advancing research into explainable AI (XAI) specifically tailored to the study of the complex, sometimes chaotic, systems within Earth system science. The project investigates how XAI can be applied to regression problems in meteorology, aiming to make machine learning models more interpretable and scientifically grounded. Through a comprehensive review of current XAI approaches and targeted experiments, the team seeks to identify and test methods that can effectively explain AI predictions in the context of evolving physical systems. By bridging data science, atmospheric science, and dynamical systems theory, the project is helping to unlock the potential of AI to provide new physical insights, improve predictive understanding, and support more informed decision-making in weather and climate applications, paving the way for more transparent, reliable, and actionable Earth system science._


# Teaching
#### MSc Big Data and Cloud Computing, University of Reading (2026)
_This module introduces the core concepts and design principles behind big data management and large-scale distributed computing platforms. It also develops professional skills in documentation, project management, and clear technical communication, preparing students to apply and adapt their knowledge as data science related technologies evolve._

#### Python Induction for Non-CS MSc and PhD students in Meteorology (2025)
_"In this induction course and likely for during your MSc or PhD studies, you will use Python to manipulate, process, analyse and display vast datasets. This induction session aims to get you up to speed only on the basics of python, numpy and matplotlib. It will not cover advanced data manipulation and plotting techniques, so we leave it up to the reader to explore resources provided at the end of these notes."_
